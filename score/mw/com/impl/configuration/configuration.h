/**
 * @brief Configuration class which stores configuration data parsed from mw com config file.
 *
 * This class will be stored in a static context by the runtime. Therefore, the deployment objects contained in this
 * class will exist for the lifetime of the program. Therefore, any pointers to the objects or values within the objects
 * will be destroyed before the objects are destroyed so lifetime issues can be avoided (unless the pointers are created
 * within a static context).
 *
 * To prevent the memory addresses of the objects changing, we make the maps containing the objects const so that they
 * cannot be updated / reordered after construction. Any additional objects must be added to a fixed size static buffer
 * allocated on the heap so that they also will never change addresses. This of course also requires that the runtime
 * never moves the global Configuration object.
